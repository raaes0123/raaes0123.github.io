            I am an Embedded Firmware Engineer and Graduate Teaching Assistant at Youngstown State University, specializing in bare-metal programming, RTOS, and embedded systems development with over 5 years of experience. With hands-on experience in microcontrollers, low-level driver development, and real-time applications, I enjoy building reliable, efficient, and resource-constrained systems.
        </p>
        <p>
Currently, I am actively seeking Embedded Firmware Engineering roles where I can apply my expertise in C/C++, ARM Cortex-M, FreeRTOS, and hardware programming, while contributing to innovative projects in IoT, robotics, and embedded product design.
        </p>
        <p>
Alongside my engineering work, I have experience in teaching and mentoring students in electronics, digital logic, and microcontroller programmingâ€”helping bridge the gap between theory and real-world application.
